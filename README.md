# Project 4: Around The U.S.

### Plan

* Start
* The
* Project

**Recent Updates**

* The project is just getting underway. There's not much to show here now, but eventually we'll be getting into the nitty-gritty of Javascript and how to update the DOM on the fly.

**Description**

* We've got (we will have got) ourselves a fancy photo uploader. This current version will start small, with the display of a photo grid and the functionality of being able to edit the author's name and title.

* Later versions will have added functionality, such as the ability to login and add your own photos.

**Working on Your Own**

* If you'd like to run this project on you're own, there's really nothing special to it. Currently, we're not hosting, so there's not way for you to get a taste of what you'd even be working with. Eventually, I'll get this up on Pages and you'll be free to peruse to your enjoyment. At that point, simply fork and go, there are no complicated dependencies to worry about.
